####Purpose
This dag tests that the user_defined_macros which allow the user to define their own custom macros works properly.
####Expected Behavior
This dag has 2 tasks that are both expected to succeed. If one or both tasks fail then there is a problem with 'user_defined_macros'.\n
The first task returns the 'macro1' and 'macro2' functions.\n
The second task checks the logs of the first task to ensure the custom macro functions printed to the logs
